2022 Summer Vacation Private Homepage Project

## Background of the project
We each had a server. It was a waste to leave this server alone, so I decided to create a personal homepage(Responsive Web).
I thought it was an opportunity to practice back-end and front-end collaboration.
It is to spend time well during vacation.
